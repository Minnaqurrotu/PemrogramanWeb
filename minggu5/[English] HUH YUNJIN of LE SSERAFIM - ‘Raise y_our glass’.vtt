1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.890
It’s kinda shitty isn’t it

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.250
Not the way we pictured it

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.860
Feels like an existential crisis

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.210
Or am I being dramatic

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.880
I wish the world would shut its mouth

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.100
Give me space to fucking sort it out

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.360
Like I’m fine just leave me alone

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.760
I’m great on my own

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.040
But if I’m being honest

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.030
I’d hate to waste us on this

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.930
But I truly hope they find their own peace of mind

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.000
I don’t know what I’d be doing without you

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
You love who I am

14
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.450
Cause I don’t care as long as I’m with you

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.850
I’ll reach for your hand

16
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.580
In this ugly world where the color is fading

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.900
You're beautiful in every color and shade I

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.170
Don’t know if you drink

19
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.590
But raise a glass to the past in the story of us

20
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.810
A little bit of complication never hurt my body I know

21
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.600
But it’s different when the target is your mind

22
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.930
And everybody’s talking shit

23
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.950
No bigger hypocrite It’s fine though

24
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.290
My sisters and I

25
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.670
we sympathize

26
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.800
But if I’m being honest

27
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.220
Never thought that I would have this

28
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.760
Back when all I needed

29
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.310
was people who will stay

30
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.000
I don’t know what I’d be doing without you

31
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.240
You love who I am

32
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.610
Cause I don’t care as long as I’m with you

33
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.810
I’ll reach for your hand

34
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.830
In this ugly world where the color is fading

35
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.080
You're beautiful in every color and shade I

36
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.330
Don’t know if you drink

37
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.690
But raise a glass

38
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.320
cause

39
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.360
It took a while to get here

40
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.710
I’m fearless but I still fear

41
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.510
You’ll disappear

42
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.400
Cause I couldn’t be

43
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.540
The person that you need

44
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.240
I won’t ever leave

45
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.370
I don’t know what I’d be doing without you

46
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.670
You love who I am

47
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.950
Cause I don’t care as long as I’m with you

48
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240
I’ll reach for your hand

49
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.860
In this ugly world where the color is fading

50
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.010
You're beautiful in every color and shade I

51
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.770
I

52
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.080
In this ugly world where the color is fading

53
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.770
You're beautiful in every color and shade I

54
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.440
Don’t know if you drink

55
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.080
But raise a glass

56
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.230
To the story of us
